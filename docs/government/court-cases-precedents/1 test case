@Government After reviewing our history, documents, laws, 
and precedents an executive order banning citizens would be
 unjust, unfair, and an overreach of power by the council. Any 
 existing executive decision that may have existed or any future executive decisions creating a government only sale or ban on XP, Bastions, Obsidian or any other product shall be ruled illegal. There are no published laws, conventions, or precedents allowing for the prevention of the sale of any goods by any citizens. A free and open market has always existed in Yoahtl. Historically the government has allowed the sale of all produc
 ts and goods by any citizen and even foreign nations as well. While the council does have the power to regulate the foreign trade of products its does not ha
 ve the power to regulat
 e the sale between citize
